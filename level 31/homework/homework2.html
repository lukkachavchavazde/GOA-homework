<!-- The <button> element is a block-level element by default, which means it takes up the full width. -->
<!-- However, text alignment inside the button is controlled by its inner content. -->
<!-- Using 'text-align: center;' on a button does not work because it is usually applied to block containers, not inline elements. -->
<!-- To center text within a button, you can use 'display: flex;' or 'text-align: center;' on the button's container. -->
