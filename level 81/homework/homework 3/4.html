4) Inheritance and the super function:
   Inheritance is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows one class to inherit 
   properties and behaviors from another class. The `super()` function is used to call the 
   parent class's constructor or methods.

5) General purpose of classes:
   Classes provide a way to define data and behaviors that are associated with a specific 
   object. They help in organizing the code structure and allow for code reuse and refinement.
