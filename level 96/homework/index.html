<!-- 1. str data type is immutable. 
     This means that once a string is created, its contents cannot be changed.
-->

<!-- 2. The .replace() method returns a new string with the desired changes. 
     It does not modify the original string, which preserves immutability.
-->

<!-- 3. No, the brackets do not perfectly match all collection types:
     list: [] — correct
     tuple: () — correct
     dict: {} — correct
     set: {} — incorrect (an empty set uses set(), not {})
-->

<!-- 4. "I created function" is not syntactically correct. 
     A proper sentence should be "I created a function" for correct English grammar.
-->

<!-- 5. Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language. 
     Identifiers with different cases are treated as different.
-->

<!-- 6. print(True + True) will output 2. 
     In Python, True is treated as 1 when used in arithmetic operations.
-->

<!-- 7. print(int("1_000_000")) will output 1000000. 
     Underscores in numeric strings are allowed for readability and ignored in conversion.
-->

<!-- 8. The actual code is not visible, so the output cannot be determined.
-->

<!-- 9. An empty list is considered a falsy value in Python. 
     It evaluates to False in a boolean context.
-->

<!-- 10. The actual code is not visible, so the output cannot be determined.
-->

<!-- 11. Yes, you can use an if statement inside a list comprehension 
     to filter elements.
-->

<!-- 12. Yes, list comprehensions can include if-else statements 
     to choose between values.
-->

<!-- 13. Yes, you can define a function inside another function. 
     These are called nested functions.
-->

<!-- 14. Yes, ZeroDivisionError is a built-in error type in Python. 
     It is raised when division by zero occurs.
-->

<!-- 15. Lambda functions are anonymous functions. 
     They are defined using the 'lambda' keyword.
-->

<!-- 16. This is a repeated question. 
     See answer 15.
-->

<!-- 17. print(not "") will output True. 
     An empty string is falsy, so 'not' of it is True.
-->

<!-- 18. It is not a lie. 
     In Python, everything is an object, including data types and functions.
-->

<!-- 19. No, "is" and "==" are not the same. 
     "==" checks for value equality, while "is" checks for identity (memory location).
-->

<!-- 20. Python is a high-level programming language. 
     It abstracts low-level details and is designed to be human-readable.
