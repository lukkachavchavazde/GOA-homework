  The ternary operator is a conditional operator that evaluates a condition and returns one of two values based on whether the condition is true or false.
  Syntax: condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;


  The && operator is a logical AND operator that checks if both conditions are true. 
  If both conditions are true, it returns the second operand, otherwise it returns the first false operand.
