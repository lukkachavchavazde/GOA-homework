<h2>PYTHON</h2>
Python is a <strong> high-level, general-purpose programming language</strong>. Its design<br>
philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.<br>
<b>Guido van Rossum</b> began working on Python in the late <em>1980s</em> as a successor to the <strong>ABC programming ,<br>
     languge</strong> and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in <i>2000</i>. Python <br>
      3.0, released in <em>2008</em>, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions.<br>
       Python 2.7.18, released in <em>2020,</em> was the last release of Python 2.<br>

         <h2>HTML</h2>
        <b> HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</b> <strong>is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a <br>
          web browser.</strong> It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as <br>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. <br>=
         The first version of<strong> HTML</strong> was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many <br>
          different versions of <strong>HTML.</strong> The most widely used version throughout the <em>2000's</em> was HTML 4.01, which <br>
          became an official standard in December <em>1999</em>. Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. <br>

          <b>JavaScript.</b>  often abbreviated as<b> JS,</b> is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML <br>
           and CSS.<strong> <i>99% </i>of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior</strong><br>
           javascript was released in december <em> 4,1995.</em><br>

           <strong>The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in <em>2000</em> and was later approved as an international <br>
           standard by Ecma  in  em 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET<br></strong>
            Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years <br>
            later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment<br>
             for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and <br>
             the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also<br>
              joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET. <br>

           <Strong> C++</Strong> is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December<br>
             2020   (informally known as <bC++20).></b> The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as , which was<br>
              then amended by the  <b> C++03,</b> <b>C++11</b>, <b>C++14</b>, and <b>C++17</b> standards. The current <b>C++20</b> standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library.<br>
               Before the initial standardization in <em>1998,</em> <b>C++</b> was developed by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since <em>1979</em> as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient<br>
                and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012, C++ has been on a three-year release<br>
                schedule withb <b>C++23</b> as the next planned standard.<br>
