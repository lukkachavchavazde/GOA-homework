# 3) Dunder Method:
# Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special methods in Python that have 
# double underscores at the beginning and end of their name. They allow customization 
# of default behavior for specific operations. Examples include `__init__`, 
# 

# 
# 4) Instance Variables:
# Instance variables are variables that are tied to a specific object of a class.
# Each object has its own copy of these variables, and they hold the object's state or data.


# 
# 5) Class Variables:
# Class variables are variables that are shared across all instances of a class.
#  They are defined at the class level and hold values that are common to all objects created from that class.
# 

# 
# 6) Blueprint:
# A blueprint in programming refers to a class, which defines the structure and behavior 
# (attributes and methods) for objects. It provides the template from which objects are created.
